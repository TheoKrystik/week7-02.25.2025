<<music throughout>> Narrator: Where is the edge of the solar system?

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.420
The answer is not

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.450
so simple

4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.660
You could say

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.870
it's where the planets end.

6
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.040
But the sun's magnetism can be felt

7
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.160
far beyond that.

8
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.290
And the sun's gravity stretches even farther.

9
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.440
Like everything

10
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.630
in exploration, it depends on how far you are willing to go.

11
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.820
music

12
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.990
tone

13
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.070
beeping

14
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.897
beeping
